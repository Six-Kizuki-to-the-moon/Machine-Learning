Misalnya bentuk gedung bagian depan Stasiun Kereta Api Tasikmalaya. Mulai dibangun tahun 1920, gedung berwarna putih ini masih berdiri kokoh namun anggun dan kini berfungsi sebagai gedung pusat pemerintahan Jawa Barat.\\nGedung Sate yang pada masa Hindia Belanda itu disebut Gouvernements Bedrijven (GB), peletakan batu pertama dilakukan oleh Johanna Catherina Coops, puteri sulung Wali Kota Bandung, Bertus Coops dan Petronella Roelofsen, mewakili Gubernur Jenderal di Batavia, J.P. Graaf van Limburg Stirum pada tanggal 27 Juli 1920, merupakan hasil perencanaan sebuah tim yang terdiri dari Ir.J.Gerber, arsitek muda kenamaan lulusan Fakultas Teknik Delft Nederland, Ir. Eh. De Roo dan Ir. G. Hendriks serta pihak Gemeente van Bandoeng, diketuai Kol. Pur. VL. Slors dengan melibatkan 2000 pekerja, 150 orang di antaranya pemahat, atau ahli bongpay pengukir batu nisan dan pengukir kayu berkebangsaan Cina yang berasal dari Konghu atau Kanton, dibantu tukang batu, kuli aduk dan peladen yang berasal dari penduduk Kampung Sekeloa, Kampung Coblong Dago, Kampung Gandok dan Kampung Cibarengkok, yang sebelumnya mereka menggarap Gedong Sirap (Kampus ITB) dan Gedong Papak (Balai Kota Bandung).\\n\\nSelama kurun waktu 4 tahun pada bulan September 1924 berhasil diselesaikan pembangunan induk bangunan utama Gouverments Bedrijven, termasuk kantor pusat PTT (Pos, Telepon dan Telegraf) dan Perpustakaan.\\nArsitektur Gedung Sate merupakan hasil karya arsitek Ir. J.Gerber dan kelompoknya yang tidak terlepas dari masukan maestro arsitek Belanda Dr.Hendrik Petrus Berlage, yang bernuansakan wajah arsitektur tradisional Nusantara.\\nBanyak kalangan arsitek dan ahli bangunan menyatakan Gedung Sate adalah bangunan monumental yang anggun mempesona dengan gaya arsitektur unik mengarah kepada bentuk gaya arsitektur Indo-Eropa, (Indo Europeeschen architectuur stijl), sehingga tidak mustahil bila keanggunan Candi Borobudur ikut mewarnai Gedung Sate.\\nBeberapa pendapat tentang megahnya Gedung Sate di antaranya Cor Pashier dan Jan Wittenberg dua arsitek Belanda, yang mengatakan \"langgam arsitektur Gedung Sate adalah gaya hasil eksperimen sang arsitek yang mengarah pada bentuk gaya arsitektur Indo-Eropa\".\\nD. Ruhl dalam bukunya Bandoeng en haar Hoogvlakte 1952, \"Gedung Sate adalah bangunan terindah di Indonesia\".\\nIr. H.P.Berlage, sewaktu kunjungan ke Gedung Sate April 1923, menyatakan, \"Gedung Sate adalah suatu karya arsitektur besar, yang berhasil memadukan langgam timur dan barat secara harmonis\". Seperti halnya gaya arsitektur Italia pada masa renaiscance terutama pada bangunan sayap barat. Sedangkan menara bertingkat di tengah bangunan mirip atap meru atau pagoda. Masih banyak lagi pendapat arsitek Indonesia yang menyatakan kemegahan Gedung Sate misalnya Slamet Wirasonjaya, dan Ir. Harnyoto Kunto.\\nKuat dan utuhnya Gedung Sate hingga kini, tidak terlepas dari bahan dan teknis konstruksi yang dipakai. Dinding Gedung Sate terbuat dari kepingan batu ukuran besar (1 Ã— 1 Ã— 2 m) yang diambil dari kawasan perbukitan batu di Bandung timur sekitar Arcamanik dan Gunung Manglayang. Konstruksi bangunan Gedung Sate menggunakan cara konvensional yang profesional dengan memperhatikan standar teknik.\\nGedung Sate berdiri di atas lahan seluas 27.990,859 mÂ², luas bangunan 10.877,734 mÂ² terdiri dari Basement 3.039,264 mÂ², Lantai I 4.062,553 mÂ², teras lantai I 212,976 mÂ², Lantai II 3.023,796 mÂ², teras lantai II 212.976 mÂ², menara 121 mÂ² dan teras menara 205,169 mÂ².\\nGerber sendiri memadukan beberapa aliran arsitektur ke dalam rancangannya. Untuk jendela, Gerber mengambil tema Moor Spanyol, sedangkan untuk bangunannya dalah Rennaisance Italia. Khusus untuk menara, Gerber memasukkan aliran Asia, yaitu gaya atap pura Bali atau pagoda di Thailand. Di puncaknya terdapat \"tusuk sate\" dengan 6 buah ornamen sate (versi lain menyebutkan jambu air atau melati), yang melambangkan 6 juta gulden - jumlah biaya yang digunakan untuk membangun Gedung Sate. Ornamen yang terbuat dari batu, terletak di atas pintu utama Gedung Sate, sering dikaitkan dengan candi Borobudur karena bentuknya yang serupa.\\nFasade (tampak depan) Gedung Sate ternyata sangat diperhitungkan. Dengan mengikuti sumbu poros utara-selatan (yang juga diterapkan di Gedung Pakuan, yang menghadap Gunung Malabar di selatan), Gedung Sate justru sengaja dibangun menghadap Gunung Tangkuban Perahu di sebelah utara.\\nDalam perjalanannya semula diperuntukkan bagi Departemen Lalulintas dan Pekerjaan Umum, bahkan menjadi pusat pemerintahan Hindia Belanda setelah Batavia dianggap sudah tidak memenuhi syarat sebagai pusat pemerintahan karena perkembangannya, sehingga digunakan oleh Jawatan Pekerjaan Umum. Tanggal 3 Desember 1945 terjadi peristiwa yang memakan korban tujuh orang pemuda yang mempertahankan Gedung Sate dari serangan pasukan Gurkha. Untuk mengenang ke tujuh pemuda itu, dibuatkan tugu dari batu yang diletakkan di belakang halaman Gedung Sate. Atas perintah Menteri Pekerjaan Umum pada tanggal 3 Desember 1970 Tugu tersebut dipindahkan ke halaman depan Gedung Sate.\\nGedung Sate sejak tahun 1980 dikenal dengan sebutan Kantor Gubernur karena sebagai pusat kegiatan Pemerintah Provinsi Jawa Barat, yang sebelumnya Pemerintahaan Provinsi Jawa Barat menempati Gedung Kerta Mukti di Jalan Braga Bandung.\\nRuang kerja Gubernur terdapat di lantai II bersama dengan ruang kerja Wakil Gubernur, Sekretaris Daerah, Para Assisten dan Biro. Saat ini Gubernur di bantu oleh tiga Wakil Gubernur yang menangani Bidang Pemerintahan, Bidang Ekonomi dan Pembangunan, serta Bidang Kesejahteraan Rakyat, seorang Sekretaris Daerah dan Empat Asisten yaitu Asisten Ketataprajaan, Asisten Administrasi Pembangunan, Asisten Kesejahteraan Sosial dan Asisten Administrasi.\\nNamun tidak seluruh Asisten menempati Gedung Sate. Asisten Kesejahteraan Sosial dan Asisten Administrasi bersama staf menempati Gedung Baru.\\nDi bagian timur dan barat terdapat dua ruang besar yang akan mengingatkan pada ruang dansa (ball room) yang sering terdapat pada bangunan masyarakat Eropa. Ruangan ini lebih sering dikenal dengan sebutan aula barat dan aula timur, sering digunakan kegiatan resmi. Di sekeliling kedua aula ini terdapat ruangan-ruangan yang di tempati beberapa Biro dengan Stafnya.\\nPaling atas terdapat lantai yang disebut Menara Gedung Sate, lantai ini tidak dapat dilihat dari bawah, untuk menuju ke lantai teratas menggunakan Lift atau dengan menaiki tangga kayu.\\nKesempurnaan megahnya Gedung Sate dilengkapi dengan Gedung Baru yang mengambil sedikit gaya arsitektur Gedung Sate namun dengan gaya konstektual hasil karya arsitek Ir.Sudibyo yang dibangun tahun 1977 diperuntukkan bagi para Pimpinan dan Anggota Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Provinsi Jawa Barat dalam melaksanakan tugas dan fungsinya sebagai Lembaga Legislatif Daerah.\\nGedung Sate telah menjadi salah satu tujuan objek wisata di kota Bandung. Khusus wisatawan manca negara banyak dari mereka yang sengaja berkunjung karena memiliki keterkaitan emosi maupun history pada Gedung ini. Keterkaitan emosi dan history ini mungkin akan terasa lebih lengkap bila menaiki anak tangga satu per satu yang tersedia menuju menara Gedung Sate. Ada 6 tangga yang harus dilalui dengan masing-masing 10 anak tangga yang harus dinaiki.\\nKeindahan Gedung Sate dilengkapi dengan taman disekelilingnya yang terpelihara dengan baik, tidak heran bila taman ini diminati oleh masyarakat kota Bandung dan para wisatawan baik domestik maupun manca negara. Keindahan taman ini sering dijadikan lokasi kegiatan yang bernuansakan kekeluargaan, lokasi shooting video klip musik baik artis lokal maupun artis nasional, lokasi foto keluarga atau foto diri bahkan foto pasangan pengantin.\\nKhusus pada hari minggu lingkungan halaman Gedung Sate dijadikan pilihan tempat sebagian besar masyarakat untuk bersantai, sekadar duduk-duduk menikmati udara segar kota Bandung atau berolahraga ringan.\\nMembandingkan Gedung Sate dengan bangunan-bangunan pusat pemerintahan (capitol building) di banyak ibu kota negara sepertinya tidak berlebihan. Persamaannya semua dibangun di tengah kompleks hijau dengan menara sentral yang megah. Terlebih dari segi letak gedung sate serta lanskapnya yang relatif mirip dengan Gedung Putih di Washington, DC, Amerika Serikat.
